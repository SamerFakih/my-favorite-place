                Beirut is a beautiful city by the Mediterranean Sea, known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and delicious food.  
                It’s a place where old meets new — ancient ruins stand beside modern buildings, and the streets are full of life, music, and energy. Beirut is a city that never stops inspiring.
